# Buzz Driver

Program to drive those little Buzz controllers.

```txt
/{游댮}\  /{游댮}\  /{游댮}\  /{游댮}\
| 游릱 |  | 游릱 |  | 游릱 |  | 游릱 |
| 游릲 |  | 游릲 |  | 游릲 |  | 游릲 |
| 游릴 |  | 游릴 |  | 游릴 |  | 游릴 |
| 游릳 |  | 游릳 |  | 游릳 |  | 游릳 |
\_游댳_/  \_游댳_/  \_游댳_/  \_游댳_/
```

## How it works

This program writes controller output to the `Local\SharedMemoryHidBuzzerReader` shared-memory file that can be read by other programs.

The output string looks like this:

```txt
RYGOBRYGOBRYGOBRYGOB
```

Each block of 5 characters represents a controller and its 5 colored buttons.

| Char position | Button | letter |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Red | R |
| 2 | Yellow | Y |
| 3 | Green | G |
| 4 | Orange | O |
| 5 | Blue | B |

When a button is pressed, the letter associated with it is present in the string, otherwise it is replaced by `x`.

Examples:

- `xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` - No button pressed.
- `RxxxxxYxxxxxxxxxxxxx` - The **red** button on **controller 1** and the **yellow** button on **controller 2** are pressed.
- `xxxxxRYxxxxxGxxxxxxx` - The **red** and **yellow** buttons on **controller 2** and the **green** button on **controller 3** are pressed.
- `RYGOBRYGOBRYGOBRYGOB` - All buttons are pressed.
